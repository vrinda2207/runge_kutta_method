The Runge-Kutta methods are a family of iterative techniques used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These methods provide a powerful and flexible approach to obtaining numerical solutions to differential equations, especially when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to find. The family on which the code is developed is: Fourth-Order (RK4): The most commonly used method, which provides a good balance between accuracy and computational effort.
